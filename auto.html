    <h2>Auto Insurance Script</h2>
    <p>Hi, this is ___ calling you from the Subsidy Department.<br>
        Well, how are you doing today?</p>
    <p>The reason for my call is just to let you know that your name and number have been selected to receive some free subsidy money where you can qualify for $500 to $1200 each, and along with additional benefits which you never have to pay back.</p>
    <p>You also don’t need to provide any of your personal or banking information. This is a totally free scheme coming through the Government, and you don’t have to pay a single dollar out of pocket.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>✅ Benefits Overview</h2>
    <p>In this call, you will get 2 benefits from the government:</p>
    <ol>

    <h2>📝 Qualification Questions</h2>
    <p>Now, may I know your age (21–64)?</p>
    <p>Okay! So let me tell you why your name and number has been selected: Due to recession, Govt used to make a survey of those people who pay their bills and taxes time to time, and from every state, 50 numbers get selected — and your number is one of them. That’s why you’re selected, okay?</p>
    <p>So, this time, all these benefits are coming from the Auto Insurance Department, which is why you will need to speak with my Auto Insurance Advisor. They will ask you some simple qualifying questions.</p>
